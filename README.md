# Hi, I’m Raghav 👋  

I’m a builder working at the intersection of **cybersecurity, full-stack development, and embedded systems**.  
My focus is practical, hands-on projects — from writing offensive security tools and tinkering with ESP32 hardware to building web apps that don’t collapse under real users.  

> *Build. Break. Rebuild stronger.*

## 🔧 What I Work With
- **Security & Red Teaming** → Network enumeration, vulnerability assessment, exploit research  
- **Development** → Python, JavaScript (React), C, Bash/PowerShell  
- **Data & Systems** → MySQL, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Embedded** → ESP32/ESP8266 prototyping, hardware-software integration
