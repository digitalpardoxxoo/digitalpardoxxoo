# Hi, Iâ€™m Raghav ðŸ‘‹  

Iâ€™m a builder working at the intersection of **cybersecurity, full-stack development, and embedded systems**.  
My focus is practical, hands-on projects â€” from writing offensive security tools and tinkering with ESP32 hardware to building web apps that donâ€™t collapse under real users.  

> *Build. Break. Rebuild stronger.*

## ðŸ”§ What I Work With
- **Security & Red Teaming** â†’ Network enumeration, vulnerability assessment, exploit research  
- **Development** â†’ Python, JavaScript (React), C, Bash/PowerShell  
- **Data & Systems** â†’ MySQL, Pandas, NumPy  
- **Embedded** â†’ ESP32/ESP8266 prototyping, hardware-software integration
